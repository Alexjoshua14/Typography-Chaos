## Starting up dev session

Run `./startup` to startup python backend server, nextjs server, and a open a code editor. Note that the startup script expects cmatrix to be installed but is not required, it simply adds a little flair.

Then `q` may be pressed with the terminal window in focus in order to make the terminal pane available for running commands.

## Ending dev sesssion

Run `./shutdown` to gracefully end the dev session
